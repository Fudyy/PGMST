<h1 align=center>PGM STAT STRACKER</h1>
<p align=center>This simple plugin allows you to track your PGM stats and send them to a MySQL database!</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I made this plugin to play with some friends and track our stats like the old Overcast Network website. In my opinion, this could be an incredible implementation for the new PGM Community plugin.</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>This plugin is meant to work along with PGM, sending the stats to a MySQL database.</p>
